<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Liam O'Rourke and I'm an american web developer from New York.
</p>

<p>I grew up on the south shroe of Long Island and have always been interested in 
  computers and how they work.  I always used to take hardware appart and see what makes 
  them tick.  when I was in middleschool my Xbox broke and I took it appart to see if I 
  could fix it.  I ended up crossing the board and it caught fire, in heinsight this was 
  actually really funny because my father told me it would happen and I ignored him.  
  After destroying a few Xboxs I graduated to personal comuputers and developed a love 
  for understanding how windows and other softwares work.</p>

<p>More recently in life Ive been working in Real-Estate but I want to persue something that 
  means a lot to me and who I am.  This is why I started learning about software development and 
  programming.  It was always in the background for me but I think its about time I stepped up 
  and tested myself.
